# Wretch
a fetch type cli program that tells you info about ur system

### Why in the hell does this exist
- We wanted to learn Rust cause it cool and speedy vroom

### Why is the code so bad and horrible
- we are starting out at this, feel free to contribute

## Install
Right now you can get the latest nightly build from the releases tab
## Building and Compiling 
 - Download rust
 - Clone Repo
 - run `cargo run --release` to run and build the best version of the project
 - *optionally* (on Linux/Mac) run `sudo mv target/release/wretch /usr/local/bin/wretch` so you can call `wretch` without defining the path (if you're on Windows, Good Luck, I Think you move the binary to \Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs to do the same thing)
